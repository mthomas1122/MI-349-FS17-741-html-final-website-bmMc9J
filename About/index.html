        <h3>Mission Statment</h3>
        <p>Humanity has been to space but we have yet to thrive in it. The farthest man has ever been from earth was during the Apollo missions to the moon, In the more than 40 years since that last mission we have been stuck close to earth. Helios Space Exploration has two main goals create manned bases on the moon and mars, and create the infrastructure to mine the vast resources contained in asteroids. Achieving these two goals will free humanity from being solely dependent on earth. </p>
